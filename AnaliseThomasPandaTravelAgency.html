		<h2>Did you ever have an interest in California?</h2>
		<p>In California there is a beach called Pfeiffer Beach in Big Sur: Purple Sand, Sea Caves & Dog Friendly. The beach can be hard to find, but if you head South it is the second road after Pfeiffer State Park. The purple sand is best after it rains. And the beach is dog friendly! The parking lot is small so when you. park you have to wait for people to exit especially during the summer. The parking is five dollars.</p>
